# Global Deforestation Analysis (2001–2022)

This project explores global deforestation trends from 2001 to 2022 using datasets from Kaggle.

---

What’s Inside
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of tree cover loss & gain
- Top countries with highest forest loss
- Net forest change computation
- Baseline model to predict carbon emissions

Dataset
Source: [Global Forest Data (2001–2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Files used:
- `Country tree cover loss.csv`
- `Country carbon data.csv`
- `Subnational 1 tree cover loss.csv`
- `Subnational 1 carbon data.csv`

Progress

# Week 1: Data Exploration
- Loaded and cleaned the datasets
- Checked column names and unique values
- Generated first visualizations of forest loss
- Identified top countries contributing to global deforestation

# Week 2: Preprocessing & Model Training
- Cleaned and merged tree cover loss and carbon emissions datasets
- Converted wide format to long format for yearly analysis
- Handled missing values and scaled numeric features
- Trained a simple linear regression model to predict carbon emissions from tree cover loss
- Split data into train and test sets
- Evaluated baseline model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score

## üîç Project Highlights

- **Data cleaning, preprocessing, and merging** of multiple datasets  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with detailed visualizations  
- Analysis of **tree cover loss, gain, and net forest change**  
- Identification of **top deforesting countries**  
- **Factor analysis** to determine significant contributors to carbon emissions  
- **Baseline and exploratory predictive models**

## üìà Progress

### **Week 1: Data Exploration**
- Loaded and cleaned datasets  
- Checked column names and unique values  
- Visualized forest loss trends  
- Identified countries with the highest deforestation  

### **Week 2: Preprocessing & Baseline Model**
- Merged tree cover loss and carbon emissions datasets  
- Converted wide format to long format for yearly analysis  
- Handled missing values and scaled numeric features  
- Trained a **linear regression model** to predict carbon emissions  
- Evaluated baseline model using **MSE** and **R¬≤**  

### **Week 3: Advanced Analysis & Visualization**
- Explored forest gain and loss trends  
- Visualized top contributors to global deforestation  
- Computed **net forest change** for each country  

### **Week 4: Factor Analysis & Key Findings**
- Identified **most important factors** influencing net carbon emissions  
- Analyzed **correlations** between deforestation and emissions  
- Highlighted patterns and trends across countries and years

## üåü Key Findings

- **Tree cover loss, industrial activity, and land use changes** strongly influence net carbon emissions  
- **Top deforesting countries** disproportionately contribute to global carbon emissions  
- Visualizations and analysis provide **actionable insights** for sustainable policy planning

## Future Work
1. Include more recent and granular datasets.
2. Build predictive machine learning models to forecast carbon emissions
3. Develop interactive front end for dynmanic visualization
